# libzmq-pub-sub-example
A simple publisher subscriber messaging pattern using ZeroMQ

Allows you to subscribe to a simple publisher of messages.

[1] Compile publisher.cpp, subscriber.cpp. Make sure you have
libzmq.

[2] Optionally you can compile demo.cpp and make sure they
are on the same level as publisher and subscriber

[3] run demo e.g ./demo 5   (where 5 is number of subscriber)

[4] if demo.cpp is not compiled, you can run publisher and subscriber
individually
